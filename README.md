## Overview
The project is a 6 weeks hands-on work for the different subgroups in Data Community AFrica. The aim is to horn the technical and creative skills within the community thus, helping us grow our portfolio and become job ready. It entails helping each of us learn how to approach a data analysis project, how to systematically clean data, applying of Exploratory Data Analysis with Excel formulas and making an information finder with the data.

## Problem statement:
Looking at the Human Resources industry, there is an impedment of low retention rate. This might be because of poor salary and work benefits or because of rough environment that might not be healthy. Hence, there is need to analyze the HR industry to ascertain with a sample what needs to be done and also improve the work ethics of the employees. The dataset used for this project is a historical data extracted fro Kaggle with the title; "Employee Analysis". It compares India with 3 states namely; New York (NY), New Zeland (NZ) and South Africa (SA) in about 3 and half years record, to determine some factors that might be relevance in solvinng the problem therein.

The project dictionary helped to ascertain the objectives to focus on while working with the data. It is true that one can deduce other objectives looking at the data, but focusing on the
objectives therein for the analysis will horn the individuals ability to stick with what is required and get the job done.

### In the dictionary we had some important questions to focus on, they are;

## Key findings:
#### These were the key findings from the questions;
- Caro Chappel Joined the company on July 4th, 2021 while, Shekhar Eswara Joined on August 16th, 2022
- The age bracket with the highest sum of rating is the young adults however, the adults has the highest average rating at 3.13yrs, indicating that the company retained more of adult employees.
- The aveerage age of the employees is 30 years.

### From the deparment analysis, here are the key findings;
- The department with mre employees is the procurement, with 55 number of employees.
- The department with the longest tenure and better bonus is perfectly depicted with a combo chart and that reflects accurately that the Human Resource [HR] department, with average tenure of 3.93 [<>4yrs] and average bonus of $2,690.
- True to te analysis, the deparments play a role in the tenure of the employees, we can infer that due to the Human Resource [HR] department having a better bonus, it definitely play a role in the tenure (retention rate) of the employees in it. We can say the same for the other department.
- If one was to apply for a role in the company, he'd apply for Human Resource [HR] in India since it is the department with the highest average salary. But New York, having the highest average salary was due to having less number of employees compared to others. This is clearly seen from the combo chart of country by no. of employees and salary paid.

### From the salary analysis, here are the key findings;
- The average salary of the Top 10 employees amounts to $117,482. With Anjushri Chandiramani having the ighest at $119, 110
- India remains the country with the highest - $7M- salary and -92- number of employees. Thus, maintaining the trend in topping other countries.
- The staff growth overtime maintains an exponential growth from 2020 to 2023. However, the data showed that in 2020 there was a record of 8 months [May - Dec]. In 2021 there was a record of 12 months, in 2022 there was a recored of 10 months [Jan - Oct], whereas in 2023 there was a record of 2 months alone [Feb & Apr].
- There exist a strong relatiosnhip between average salary and the ratings. This can be clearly seen from the scatter plot.

## Conclusion:
The entire analysis have unravel the underlying ill in the countries. First of, the African country (South Africa) lacks the grit to retain her staffs. This is due to low salary which have led to poor performance in the region. The other performed better although there are still some work to be done. Te company have young minds as their workforce, hence, the process of work in each deparment should be optimized to enable them deliver and meetup with client expectations. The staff growth can not be accounted for since the data is not consistent for the entire 4 years of record. However, we can say it is exponential with a surging rise in June and July indicating that this months are the hallmark of hiring new and fresh talents into the company's vision.

## Recommendation:
Encourage salary that appreciates inflation, work benefits, enabling environment, training sessions, healthy competition should be a focus for the company in order to retain her staffs and maintain a steady workforce in the market.
